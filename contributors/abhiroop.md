Couldn't do it live as I was busy recording stuffs

You might not know me, so let me give you an introduction...

I am a person, whose name doesn't matter, his life is full of disappointment, nad he does nothing but to chase his peer mates, but always fails miserably.

My English is shit, but somehow this person managed to get a good...

`who said it's good, you just fucking got placed in CST due to your CGPA, you asshole`

so anyways, that other person is my past, and I would like you to forget him....

Oh, you wanna know who he is?

well then, lemme start a good ol' story..

you can consider him as my past self, he just got enrolled to our college, with  a lot of dreams. He first and foremost had a plan to do the "impossible" thing, as called by his friend: Department Change, he was a consistent student, was athletic, had everything planned, and also got good grade `*really good`.

To put it simply, he was a perfect contrast of myself. He was on his right track to change his department, but he forgot to think about one thing. _What would he do after department change?_

His department changed, but a lack of plan destroyed him. and that forged him into me. A depressed asshole, who just wants to die.

`Fuck him, I am here and will destroy you and your mindset. I have a lot of things to show to this world. AND I WILL DO IT sooner or later`
